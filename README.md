# Miscellaneous Numerical Experiments

### CTT.c

CTT (Conformal Transverse Traceless) is a scheme for solving the constraint equations emerged from the 3+1 decomposition of the Einstein field equation. This code uses the puncture method and integration method to solve the initial data for a spinning blackhole.

### rigid.c

This code simulates molecule dynamics assuming rigid ball interaction. Unfortunately there're too many bugs that the code doesn't produce expected results.

### magnetic\_levitation.c

This is a code to simulate a current field that I encounter during a physics experiment.

### bloch.py

Use python to calculate the non interaction band structure
